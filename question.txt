# What does this command mean
I got the error that the .terraform file is too large and cannot be pushed into github\
git filter-branch -f --index-filter 'git rm --cached -r --ignore-unmatch .terraform/'

In creating the NAT gateway what if i want to create just one but have to loop through count for the subnetID what do I do

#Why Should be destination everywhere for the private route

I am stuck in directing load balancer traffic to the private subnet that has the ecc2 instances.
I do not know if I have to create a subnet group or if when I add them to a SG it can suffice.
